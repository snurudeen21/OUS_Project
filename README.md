  ##Just Short Codes For Simple Task. This an Excel VBA code Generator for specific purpose using the PchipInterpolator of the scipy.interpolate module
Let's say you have a set of data points and you fit it through a curve to generate a function: y = f(x) = a*x^3 + b*x^2 + c*x + d
This code generates uses the PchipInterpolator from scipy.interpolate module to generate this function that relates the physical quantities for which data points
      are entered as input in arrays: x and y
It then genrates an Excel VBA code that can be used to make an inbuilt function in an Excel Spreadsheet using the Macros Option
The steps to deploy the code are highlighted here in:

# Download the File vba_code.py
# Open the file on any python code executor on your PC
# Edit the content of the x and y arrays on line 6 and 16 respectively
# The arrays are x (independent variable) and y (dependent variable) data values of the physical quantity to be modelled.
    Note that the number of data points in x and y must be equal for the code to work
# Run the code and open the <EvaluatePx_AutoGenerated.txt> and <PchipIntervalsReport.txt> files using any suitable text editor
    The file are saved by default in localdisk --> Users --> user
# The code for the Excel VBA is saved in <EvaluatePx_AutoGenerated.txt>
# A report of the equations genrated by the Piecewise Interploator function at intervals in the data  is saved in <PchipIntervalsReport.txt>

# Open Microsoft Excel
# Go the Developer Tab
    If Developer Tab is not activated, activate it from File --> Options --> Customize Ribbon --> Activate the Developer Tab
# Open Visual Basic --> Insert --> Module
# Paste the content of <EvaluatePx_AutoGenerated.txt> in the blank page and save
    Note if you have the function (EvaluatePx) in the module list, replace its content with the content of <EvaluatePx_AutoGenerated.txt>
# Got the Excel Worksheet and call the function: =EvaluatePx(Number or Cell_Number_containing_a_Number) [Usage: =EvaluatePx(780) or =EvaluatePx(C45)]
